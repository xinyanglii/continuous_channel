# Computing Capacity-Cost Function for Continuous Channels in Wasserstein Space

## Introduction

This repo implements algorithms to computing the capacity-cost function of discrete and continuous memoryless channel.

See the paper [Computing Capacity-Cost Function for Continuous Channels in Wasserstein Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10670) for more details.

ABSTRACT="This paper investigates the problem of computing capacity-cost (C-C)
functions for continuous channels. Motivated by the Kullback-Leibler
divergence (KLD) proximal reformulation of the classical Blahut-Arimoto
(BA) algorithm, the Wasserstein distance is introduced to the proximal term
for the continuous case, resulting in an iterative algorithm related to the
Wasserstein gradient descent. Practical implementation involves moving
particles along the negative gradient direction of the objective function's
first variation in the Wasserstein space and approximating integrals by the
importance sampling (IS) technique. Such formulation is also applied to the
rate-distortion (R-D) function for continuous source spaces and thus
provides a unified computation framework for both problems."
