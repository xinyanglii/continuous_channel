# Computing Capacity-Cost Function for Continuous Channels in Wasserstein Space

## Introduction

This repo implements algorithms to computing the capacity-cost function of discrete and continuous memoryless channel.

See the paper Computing Capacity-Cost Function for Continuous Channels in Wasserstein Space for more details.

## Getting Started

Install this package into your `conda` environment, say `cdopt`.

```bash
conda create -n cdopt python=3.11 pip
conda activate cdopt
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

## Reproduce the Results

To reproduce the results in the paper, you can run the following commands.

```bash
# MIMO-AWGN
bash scripts/mimoawgn.sh

# Rayleigh Fading without CSIR
bash scripts/fading.sh

# Rayleigh Fading with CSIR
bash scripts/fading_csir.sh
```

The plots can be generated by the notebook `notebooks/plot.ipynb`.

For more details about the simulation configurations, please refer to the `configs` folder and the comments in the source code.

## Examples

You can find examples in the folder `notebook`.
